# Why learn a functional language?

## 1- Favors modularity and decomposition

    testing is easier, there will be no bugs (as they are specific)

## 2- Immutability

    the data cannot be changed

    No side effects:

    *Predictability,

    *Parallelism,

    *Take advantage of multithreading,

    *Possible competition.

## 3- Testing is easy

    *Pure functions have no side effects,

    *Tests can run in parallel,

    *We will almost not need such mocks and strategies.
